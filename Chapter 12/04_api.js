TODO: API ~ Application Programming Interface:
- A set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

- An API defines the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with the software component, be it operating systems, libraries, or services.
- APIs are used to enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to communicate and share data.

- APIs can be used to access web services, databases, and other resources, enabling developers to build applications that leverage existing functionality and data.
- APIs can be public, allowing third-party developers to access and use them, or private, used internally within an organization.

- APIs can be RESTful, using HTTP requests to access and manipulate data, or SOAP-based, using XML for communication.
- APIs can also be categorized as synchronous or asynchronous, depending on how they handle requests and responses.

- APIs can be used to access cloud services, enabling developers to build applications that leverage the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing.
