// Method Chaining is a technique used to simplify code by calling multiple methods sequentially on the same object. The return value of one method is the object that the next method is called on. This allows you to write code that is more concise and easier to read.

let msg = " Hello World! ";
let newMsg = msg.trim()
console.log(newMsg); // "Hello World!"
